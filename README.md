# Pratermade Serverless CMS

This is a simple CMS that uses Django, Zappa and other open source projects to build a basic serverless Content Management System.
It uses AWS Lambda, AWS RDS, and AWS S3 to do all the hosting. It is hoped that a release build will allow for the use of S3 for the database, removing the cost of RDS.

**This is a very early build, though functional, but way buggy**
